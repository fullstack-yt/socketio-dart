A Flutter App that connects to any Socket.IO server.

It can send 4 different events to the server: *echo*, *broadcast*, *joinRoom*, *room*.

Clicking on lightning icon will open a text prompt, where you can enter any URL that hosts a Socket.IO Endpoint.

Then simply use the text field at the bottom to send events to the server.
